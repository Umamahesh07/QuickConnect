This README provides an overview of the technologies used in the QuickConnect project, a full stack responsive web application built using Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and mySQL. One of the key features of this web app is the ability to upload an XML file, which will then automatically insert the data contained in the file into the database.

Technologies Used

Node.js: Server-side runtime environment for handling back-end logic using JavaScript.
JavaScript: Programming language used for both front-end and back-end development.
HTML: Language for structuring web content.
CSS (Bootstrap): Framework for styling and responsive design.
mySQL: Database system for data storage and management.
Project Overview
The QuickConnect project aims to create a user-friendly web application with a responsive design. By leveraging the power of Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and mySQL, this application offers a seamless experience across devices and platforms.

A standout feature of QuickConnect is the ability to upload XML files, allowing users to easily import data into the system. Upon uploading an XML file, the application processes the data and automatically inserts it into the appropriate database tables.
